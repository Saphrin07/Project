<h1>This is how you make a list</h1>

<ol>

<li>an ordered list looks like this</li>

<li>it has numbers beside each item</li>

<li>this could be useful when chronologically listing things</li>

</ol>

<ul>

<li>this is an unordered list</li>

<li>it has dots beside each item</li>

<li>this could be useful when you are simply listing facts or subpoints</li>

</ul>

<p1>as you can see, lists are offset a little to normal pragraphs and headings</p1>
